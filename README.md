# Task Manager

The Task Manager is a Python application designed to help users organize and track their tasks efficiently. It allows users to create, start, pause, and remove tasks, categorizing them as daily, weekly, or monthly.


# Features

-   **Task Creation**: Users can create tasks by specifying a name, duration (in minutes), and category (daily, weekly, or monthly).
-   **Task Management**: Users can start, pause, and remove tasks as needed.
-   **Category Organization**: Tasks are organized by categories (daily, weekly, monthly) for easy tracking.
-   **Task Reset**: Daily, weekly, and monthly tasks reset automatically at the beginning of each respective period.
-   **Graphical User Interface**: The application has a user-friendly GUI built with the tkinter library.
-   **Single Task Instance**: Users are restricted to creating only one instance of each task to prevent multiple tasks with the same name.
